## Node-FormCreation Example

This is a example how you can use Typeform I/O to create typeforms based on
user data you already have. In this demo, the user data is stored in the filesystem
but a more real life scenario would probably involve loading the data from your
database.



## Requirements

* NodeJS v0.12.0 or higher
* An API-key from Typeform I/O (You can get one [here](http://docs.typeform.io/v0.1/page/signup))


## Installation

* Clone the project to your local machine
* Inside the project folder, run `npm install`
* When finished, run `API_KEY=your_api_key npm start` to run the application, replacing `your_api_key` with the API-key you have for Typeform I/O
